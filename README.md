# Nillionly fans Telegram Bot ðŸ¤–

## Project Description

A secure Telegram bot powered by Nillion's advanced encryption technology that enables private photo sharing with end-to-end encryption. Built with Node.js and the Telegraf framework.

## Short Description

Secure photo sharing Telegram bot with Nillion encryption for maximum privacy and security!

## How it's Made

We built this bot using a powerful combination of technologies:

* Node.js & TypeScript: For type-safe backend development
* Telegraf: For Telegram bot framework integration
* Nillion SDK: For advanced encryption capabilities
  * @nillion/client-react-hooks
  * @nillion/client-vms
  * @nillion/client-wasm

The bot leverages Nillion's encryption technology to provide secure photo storage and sharing. Photos are processed using Sharp for optimization before being encrypted and stored. The bot runs on Vercel's serverless infrastructure using their KV storage for data persistence.

Key features include:

* End-to-end encrypted photo storage
* Secure photo retrieval
* Image compression and thumbnail generation
* User account management
* Command-based interaction
